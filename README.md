This project was created for WVU's SENG 560 software reuse class using the fantastic mathlib framework from here:
https://github.com/skitterm/math-lib

Using this math-lib framework was incredibly easy. 100% black box reuse, I did not have to modify anything. The documentation was clear to me, and I was able to bring this framework in with very little effort by following the math-lib documentation.
